Say your name. 

Tell us the name of your game. 

Tell us a 2 sentence elevator pitch for your game (take this from your Tweet that you made about the game earlier in the week). 

Play the game to the class while screen sharing. Narrate anything that is cool. 

What is the coolest part of your game? 

What part are you most proud of? 

What part was almost too challenging to finish? 

What part was so hard to understand in the beginning, but now it’s obvious to you? 

If you got any outside feedback about your game, what did you learn? 

What is the most important lesson you learned in this class? 

What do you want to be when you grow up? 

What has been your most improved skill since being this course? 

If you could change one thing about this coding camp, what would it be?
