### Apple Music

Before streaming was the big thing, Apple Music was king over the music industry. A central feature of iTunes was its ability to take songs that you had purchased and copy them elsewhere. This led to lots of people creating playlist CDs that they would start selling to other people. Apple bans this in their terms of service.
