    How to work in a pair  

Set up regular times during class to check in with one another 

Every 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30, minutes, 1 hour? 

The more attention you give to your partner, the more welcome and included they will feel. 

How shall we divide the work between us? What parts of the project would you like to work on?  

How should you get your partner’s attention when they’re not looking at you? 

How do you define success? What is our goal? 

For how long should you work to solve a difficult problem before asking your partner for help? For long should you both work to solve a difficult problem before asking the class instructor for help? 

Takeaway lessons: Communicate. Proactively. As Often as You Can Stand It.
