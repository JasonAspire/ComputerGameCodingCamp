### Introduction to MakeCode
   0. Go over homework
   1. Teach kids how to download game to physical BrainPad device and play the game there. [https://www.brainpad.com/start-making/](https://www.brainpad.com/start-making/) (30 mins)

        - https://makecode.com/_53j7E709j3Ec
   10. If Pacman eats power pellet, he should be able to kill the ghost. (2 min + 5 min)
        - Add a variable to game to keep track of &quot;scared ghost&quot; mode. Set to false at beginning of the game.
        - Set to true in collision with power pellet.
        - In collision with ghost, add if statement to check for scared ghost mode and if true, ghost dies instead of pacman.
          - Ghost goes back to ghost box, but Pacman gets points and continues on. 100 points.
        - https://makecode.com/_A86RKyJEeJHg
   11. Restore balance to game. (1 min + 2 min)
        - Set a 30 second time limit for scared ghost mode.
        - Create a countdown timer. At end, turn off scared ghost mode (goes back to avoid ghost mode).
        - If Pacman eats a power pellet, turn on scared ghost mode and start the countdown timer at 30 seconds.
          - We need to keep the power pellet sound going while power pellet advantage is on while the countdown is going.
          - Introduce background music to indicate a game mode.
        - If Pacman eats another power pellet, reset timer back to 30 seconds.
        - https://makecode.com/_MvectzKDmd2Y
   12. Make it clear when you&#39;re in scared ghost mode. (5min + 10min)

   13. Improve AI for ghost (10 min + 15 min)
        - Introduce Chase mode.
        - Chase mode aims the ghost at Pacman.
        - Chase mode aims the ghost at Pacman.
          - Collect list of tiles left, right, and in front of me that are not walls. (L, R, F)
          - Compute vector v to my target point.
          - Choose closest tile that reduces distance to target point.
            1. If no tile makes distance go down, choose to go forwards.
          - Compute the distance between the L and target point, R and target point, F and target point.
          - Pick the smallest distance. Head in that direction.
          - If there&#39;s more than one distance that is the smallest, pick between them randomly.
          - If F, don&#39;t change direction.
          - If L, Rotate-vector(vx, vy, by 90 degrees).
          - If R, Rotate-vector(vx, vy, by 90 degrees).
          - Change my vx and vy to that direction.
          - Move one step forward in the direction of travel.

   14. Restore balance to the game (10 min + 15 min)
        - Ghost has two modes: Scatter and Chase. Switch between modes every 30 seconds.
        - Introduce Scatter mode to balance out Chase mode.
        - Scatter mode reuses earlier AI for random movement.
        - Scatter == Chase with top left corner as your target point.
        - Modify Scatter mode to aim at a corner of the screen to be more predictable.
        - https://makecode.com/_1Ebagqby0Pbo
   15. Restore balance to the game (1 min + 2 min)
        - Mess with Pacman and Ghost speeds.
        - When Pacman pellet, ghost goes into scatter mode and stays there and Ghost speed drops to 50% below Pacman.
        - https://makecode.com/_9J2AcC3TiDdY
   1. Extra Credit
      1. Add a second ghost.
      2. Add a second AI for ghost 2.

        - Change the aim for Scatter mode to another corner of the maze.
        - Change from Scatter to Chase after a shorter time, and stay in Chase mode longer.
        - Change between Scatter and Chase up to 3 times before remaining in Chase mode until end.
      - Make a pretty maze with tiles.
    - Add difficulty by speeding things up.
    - Add bonus cherries when things are going fast.

        - Draw cherry
  - Homework: Add 2 more ghosts. Create new AIs for each.
  - Rules

      - Pacman can be in the avoid ghost phase or attack ghost phase.
      - Game starts in the avoid ghost phase.
      - If Pacman touches a pellet, he eats it and gains a point.
      - If Pacman touches a power pellet, he eats it and gains 10 points, and game switches into attack ghost phase.
      - If Pacman is in avoid ghost, if he touches a ghost, he dies.
      - If Pacman is in attack ghost, if he touches a ghost, the ghost dies.
      - Once game switches into attack ghost phase, after 30 seconds, it switches back into avoid ghost phase.
      - If Pacman dies, he loses one life and goes back to start and game resumes in avoid ghost phase.
      - If ghost dies, he goes back to the ghost start box.

    - Game Mechanics
      - Movement ( **1** )
        - Activity: Create a character and make it respond to the gamepad (keyboard-based) [This will take awhile, we haven&#39;t had them use makecode yet...]
      - Collisions (video example of a collision) ( **3** )
        - Example: Bullets
          - How does it work? What happens if it hits? Misses?
        - Types of colliders
        - Mechanics
        - Reactions
        - Sensing collisions
        - Collisions with other players
        - Collisions with non-players e.g. walls
      - Player
        - Controlled by you
      - Non player
        - Randomness
        - AI
      - Rules (Game play?)
        - Scoring
          - Are all points worth the same?
        - Lives
          - How do players regenerate?
          - How many lives do they get?
          - Where do they come back to life? Does the entire board get reset?
        - How does a player win?
        - Turn-taking
        - Can players and enemies do the same things?
        - Does the game speed change over time to make it easier/harder?
      - Feedback loops ( **2** )
        - Actions have a consequence
        - But not all consequences have to be life or death
          - g. Can I bump another player without killing him?
          - g. What happens when I hit a wall?
        - Win more time, points, speed, access to extra levels.

    - Game State (define first)
      - Whose turn is it?
      - What does each player carry?
      - How fast is the player moving?
      - Is the player jumping, running, walking, flying, falling?
      - Where are the other characters?
      - How fast is the game running?
      - What constraints are there on the game play?
      - **Activity:** Reconstruct the game state
        - We get out a chess board or monopoly board and put all the pieces in a legit configuration.
        - Each student writes down the state of the game for themselves.
        - We hide the board.
        - Each student teams up with another to discuss their game state and create the union of their two descriptions.
        - One team speaks up and tells us how to recreate the state of the board.
        - We compare with the original and see what&#39;s missing.
