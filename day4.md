      - Activity
        - Then have students select any MakeCode arcade game and play with for 5 minutes. Meet with partner.

          - Meet back in class. Each student will walk through their chosen game and share with peers. (20 mins)
      
      - Activity
        - Drawing a pretty maze with tilemap
        - Using preexisting tile map categories: Forest, Dungeon, etc.
        - Show them how to create Pacman&#39;s maze.
   
   - Homework: Draw a new maze. (20 mins)
        - Let&#39;s draw a new PacMan maze. Do this on paper. You can use another piece of paper as a ruler if you do not have one. Create your own maze, but make sure that _you do not have any dead ends_. Don&#39;t forget to leave a place for Pacman to start the game. Leave an empty spot somewhere else in case Pacman encounters any future enemies.
        - This might take multiple sheets of paper and thinking about how the maze works to get a working prototype. That is okay!
        - Program this new maze into your Pacman game tilemap before class tomorrow.
